# here  is best way for formatting strings... using f-strings..!!

var1 = "sanket"
var2 = "modi"
print(f"this is me , {var1} {var2}")

# also
print("this is me ,", var1, var2)
# but this method will be quite slower when dealing with so many string variables

print("this is me , %s " % var1)
# most boring way..!!   :(
